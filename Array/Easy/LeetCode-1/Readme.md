# Leetcode 1 - Two Sum

## Problem
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

## Example
```java
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9  
Output: [0,1]
